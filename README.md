# Tracer
This program takes IP addresses stored in a text file, traces them, and outputs the results into another text file.
## How to Use
Tracer is very simple. Have a text file ready with IPV4 addresses stored on separate lines in the file. Make sure this file is in the same destination as the program when it is run. Start the program and follow the instructions.
(An internet connection is required for Tracer to work)
## Usage Examples
Say you have a Wireshark capture file filled with thousands of IPV4 addresses captured over a network. Simply have Wireshark copy these addresses to your clipboard and paste them into a text file. Let Tracer do the rest of the work.
#### Things to Note
This program can generate files that may exceed the storage capacity of the device it is being used on. Ensure that your device can store the amount text being generated by the program.
(For the greatest efficiency, split large amounts of IP addresses into smaller files and have the program work on them separately. This will ensure that the storage capacity of the device is not exceeded and the network it is hosted on is not overloaded)
